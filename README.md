# Tatort-Campus-CMS
A Content Management System using Dart &amp; Java EE &amp; MySQL

I programmed this selfmade content management system for the website of the student newspaper Tatort Campus of the Hochschule Harz, University of Applied Sciences.

The client is programmed in Google Dart. This was my first serious work with this new language and I programmed this, when Dart was in an early state, thus it does not follow the style guides. 

The gallery uploader is completely self-written. All the user has to do is to drop the images inside the gallery area. Now he can decide which image should be used as the preview of the category and how it should be cropped.

The back end is a Java EE application running on a Glassfish server. With the Java API for RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS) it was really easy to build an interface the Google Dart client communicates with.
